#  TinyApp URL Shortening Project 

This app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

Build an HTTP Server that handles requests from the browser (client). Along the way I was introduced to some more advanced JavaScript and Node concepts, and also learn more about Express, a web framework which is very popular in the Node community.

## Purpose

**This project was made by [Daniel Seniv](https://github.com/n1dddd) and was completed as part of the [Lighthouse Labs](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs) curriculum.**
